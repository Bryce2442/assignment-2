  <!-- Paragraph explaining the creation of the web -->
  <p>
    The web was created in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee. Lee introduced key technologies like HTML, 
    URL, and HTTP. The name of the first browser was the WorldWideWeb.
    By the mid-1990s, the World Wide Web transitioned into the dynamic web.

  <!-- Paragraph about dynamic web technologies -->
  <p>
    The dynamic web brought interactivity and user-generated content. Technologies like JavaScript, 
    AJAX, and database integration enabled websites to update content without refreshing the page. 
    This paved the way for modern applications like social media, online banking, and streaming platforms.
